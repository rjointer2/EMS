## User Story

Employee Management System
1.            As a Company Owner, I want to register a hire new employee, fire, edit and update employees profile.
Database store the users
- Admin page -> Admin Token -> do whatever they want; fire, hire, edit employee
   create/edit schedules
- Employee -> Create a login, set availability, request for shifts
- Chat Application => able to talk to whomever, store the edit, send emojis,
   auto scroll, save chats, delete chats
- Front End, interaction -> User input -> creating their accounts ->
   editing schedules, fetching data
2.            Login System -> JWT (I can prevent unauthorized logins by former/ex-employees.
3.        The chat application (can chat quickly, can approve leave, can cover shifts)
